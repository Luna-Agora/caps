### Summary & Motivation
For this project I wanted to Analyse Nashville in Davidson County and the resources available to the public and all civilians. I will be taking a deep-dive to see what parts of nashville are underserved, and identifying areas that are less hostpitable to the disadvantaged and unhoused population.
Resources observed:
-Water
-Food
-WiFi
-Health Clinics
-Prescription Disposal Sites
-Police and Fire Dept.
-Library Locations

Economics Observed(by zipcode):
Workforce population:
-Employed
-Unemployed:
Income
-Mean
-Median

### Questions
1. What correlations do Unemployment, Income, and Population have on access to public resources in Nashville? 
2. What area has the most access? What area has the least?
3. Does public wifi access directly correlate with Population? Or Unemployment? Income?
4. create an area score.

#### Technologies Used
Python
Power BI
PowerPoint
Git


##### Data Collection, Cleaning, and Normalisation
The most recently available data was used for this project

Getting all the data cleaned and formated correctly took well over 1000 lines of code, pulling data from over 30 source csv's.

###### Challenges
Initially finding the zipcode data was hard, 

The geospatial stuff was the most challenging on this project. 
Trying to get maps that plot multiple resources is still an ongoing challenge.



###### SOURCES:
CENSUS (2022)
&
DATA.NASHVILLE.GOV

###### FUTURE PLANS:
i would like to bring in data like shelters(unhoused and womens), needle exchanges, foodbanks, and other rescouses to add to my dashboard. on top of that i would like bring in othe economic factors like race, poverty, computer access, and occupied homes, ect...

further more i would like to re-analyze based on neighborhoods instead of zipcodes.

NOTE: If you would like a detailed walkthrough of this project, don't hesitate to reach out. I am still expanding the folium map in this project!
