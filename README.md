### Summary & Motivation
For this project I wanted to Analyse Nashville in Davidson County and the resources available to the public and all civilians. I will be taking a deep-dive to see what parts of nashville are underserved, and identifying areas that are less hostpitable to the disadvantaged and unhoused population.
Resources observed:
-Water
-Food
-WiFi
-Health Clinics
-Prescription Disposal Sites
-Police and Fire Dept.
-Library Locations

Economics Observed(by zipcode):
Workforce population:
-Employed
-Unemployed:
Income
-Mean
-Median

### Questions
1. What correlations do income and population have on access to public resources in Nashville? 
2. What zipcodes in Nashville are least served?

4. Does public wifi access directly correlate with population? Or Unemployment?
